      <h3>White Kitty</h3>
      <img src="img/white-cat.jpg" alt="White Cat"/>
      <p>
        This little lady was found all dirty and hungry in a waste after her mother abandoned her! Lucky for her, we were there just in time to take her and get her back in spark.

      <h3>Brown and Naughty</h3>

      <p>
        This feller is a true gentleman, but more often than that he is running around like crazy. Maybe is his young age... His cuteness compensates for everything on the other hand, so taking and teaching him about life would be the right thing to do!

      <h3>Yellow Birdie</h3>
      <img src="img/canary.jpg" alt="Canary"/>
      <p>
        Look at this little tennis ball (it's a metaphor!). It can fly out of joy if you take good care of it, and it will return love with the same extent.

      <h3>A Colorful Rainbow</h3>
      <img src="img/parrot.png" alt="Parrot"/>
      <p>
        Ain't she gorgeous?! Look at her! Her colors are just majestic. Like a beautiful rainbow flying over the clouds after a rain...

      <h3>I Am The Night!</h3>
      <img src="img/owl.jpg" alt="Owl"/>
      <p>
        The night decides to come out in the middle of the day sometimes... I suppose he likes to show off its magnificent nut-like colored feathers. Well let him!

      <h3>Touch Me And I'll Hug You Tightly</h3>

      <p>
        Lucifer may have taken its form in the past and deceived Eve to bite the apple, but this lady is harmless (well most of the time...). She just wants some love and gives free hugs to all.

      <h3>I Look Good, Don't I?</h3>

      <p>
        Unfairly labeled for being a rodent and most often underestimated for being smart. I know how it sounds but this little guy is actually such a gentleman when it comes to keeping you company late at night. He deserves a chance...

      <h3>My Expression Says It All</h3>

      <p>
        Just buy me now... enough said... (laughs) No seriously how can you not be won over by that adorable face. They may be called pigs (and act like ones), but they are the ultimate pet to bring to every party, dinner, walk. The list of things to do with this fur ball is endless.
