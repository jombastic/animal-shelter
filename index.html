    <div class="intro">
      <h3>Welcome!</h3>
      <p>
        We exist solely for one purpose: to protect the animals in need of home until they get a home. And our purpose is supported by dedicated people who work tirelessly to provide a warm place for the fluffy and feathery ones and make sure they enjoy the right kind of care and love. And to get in the right hands afterwards, of course. Our good veterinarians take make sure the animals stay healthy and well fed.
      </p>

      <h4>We include:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Cats</li>
        <li>Dogs</li>
        <li>Canaries</li>
        <li>Parrots</li>
        <li>Owls</li>
        <li>Snakes</li>
        <li>Mice</li>
        <li>Guinea Pigs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With that being said, it's ours to worry about their health until they reach your generous hands, so be like that and adopt one fluff of joy now!

      <p>
        This little lady was found all dirty and hungry in a waste after her mother abandoned her! Lucky for her, we were there just in time to take her and get her back in spark.

        This feller is a true gentleman, but more often than that he is running around like crazy. Maybe is his young age... His cuteness compensates for everything on the other hand, so taking and teaching him about life would be the right thing to do!

        Look at this little tennis ball (it's a metaphor!). It can fly out of joy if you take good care of it, and it will return love with the same extent.
