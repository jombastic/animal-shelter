      <h3>Welcome!</h3>
      <p>
        We exist solely for one purpose: to protect the animals in need of home until they get a home. And our purpose is supported by dedicated people who work tirelessly to provide a warm place for the fluffy and feathery ones and make sure they enjoy the right kind of care and love. And to get in the right hands afterwards, of course. Our good veterinarians take make sure the animals stay healthy and well fed.
      </p>

      <h4>We include:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Cats</li>
        <li>Dogs</li>
        <li>Canaries</li>
        <li>Parrots</li>
        <li>Owls</li>
        <li>Snakes</li>
        <li>Mice</li>
        <li>Guinea Pigs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With that being said, it's ours to worry about their health until they reach your generous hands, so be like that and adopt one fluff of joy now!
